= Fail on Changes Plugin

This plugin allows your build to fail if it is trying to package without tracking changes to another branch. It
is particularly useful if you have another master branch happening and you don't want unexpected reversions happening,
particularly on the build server.

It uses JGit to load the repository, and specifies one other branch to track. It will fail if changes are
detected and put them into the log.
